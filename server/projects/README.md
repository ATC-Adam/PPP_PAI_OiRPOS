# Projects Module API Documentation

## Overview

The Projects module provides a set of REST API endpoints to manage projects and their associated users. It integrates with the existing authentication system, requiring users to be authenticated via the `auth_token` cookie.

## Introduction

This module extends the base API by providing CRUD operations on `Project` resources and functionalities to manage user assignments within these projects. Each project can have multiple users assigned, each with an optional role.

**Key Features:**
- Create, read, update, and delete projects.
- Assign and remove users from projects.
- Retrieve detailed information about projects, including assigned users.

---

## Prerequisites

- A running Django server with the `projects` application installed and migrated.
- The `accounts` module for user authentication.
- A valid `auth_token` cookie obtained through the `/api/login/` endpoint.

---

## Authentication

All endpoints in the Projects module require the user to be authenticated. Authentication is handled via a cookie named `auth_token` set by the `/api/login/` endpoint.

Ensure that `auth_token` is included in all requests to protected endpoints. Browsers handle this automatically if cookies are set. For tools like Postman, make sure the cookie is preserved between requests.

---

## Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/`. The `projects` endpoints are provided via a DRF Router and thus available at `/api/projects/` and subsequent paths.

  Returns a list of all projects.

## Request and Response Examples

**Create a Project (POST `/api/projects/`):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/projects/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Website Redesign","description":"Revamp the company site"}' \
  --cookie "auth_token=<your_token_here>"
```

**Retrieve Project Details (GET `/api/projects/1/`):**
```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/projects/1/ \
  --cookie "auth_token=<your_token_here>"
```

---

## Error Handling

Common error scenarios:

- **401 Unauthorized:** Missing or invalid `auth_token`.
- **400 Bad Request:** Invalid data, such as missing `user_id` or `name`.
- **404 Not Found:** Project or user does not exist.

Error responses generally follow the format:
```json
{
  "detail": "Descriptive error message."
}
```

### Initialize database with some default values
To do so run the command below:
```bash
python manage.py loaddata initial_data.json
```
After the execution the database should have initial values.
